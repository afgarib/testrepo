For the purpose of developing models with the intent of prediciting accident severity, our dependent variable will be the SEVERITYCODE which will be depedent upon the following variables: JUNCTION, WETAHER, ROADCOND and LIGHTCOND - as these are the variables provided that seem to be statistically significant to the severity of an accident within a dataset. 

These independent variables can be understood as our feature selection which will then be further processed and cleaned to be utilized in our model. If in case of any additions or subtractions to features, i will make updates in this file.
