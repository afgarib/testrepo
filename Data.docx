For the purpose of developing models with the intent of prediciting accident severity, our dependent variable will be the SEVERITYCODE which will be depedent upon the following variables: JUNCTIONTYPE, WETAHER, ROADCOND and LIGHTCOND - as these are the variables provided that seem to be statistically significant to the severity of an accident within a dataset. 

Descriptions - 
SEVERITYCODE could be one of 5 options which are described as: 0-unknown, 1-prop damage, 2-injury, 2b-serious injury, 3-fatality
JUNCTIONTYPE - the type of junction the accident took place at, for example at an intersection or a mid block 
WEATHER - weather at the time of incident e.g, overcast, raining or clear 
LIGHTCOND - the condition of the light at the time of incident e.g, daylight, dark
ROADCOND - the condition of the road at the time of incident e.g, Dry or Wet 


These independent variables can be understood as our feature selection which will then be further processed and cleaned to be utilized in our model. If in case of any additions or subtractions to features, i will make updates in this file.
